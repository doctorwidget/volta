CRUD
***************

A demonstration page intended for showing basic CRUD operations. We'll let users add to a list of things. For now we'll just have ``(add)``, ``(get-all)`` and ``(delete-all)`` operations, since the goal is just to see the full end-to-end operation, not provide actually useful tools.

Perhaps most importantly, these examples will work only for a logged-in user, and each user will have their own list of stuff.
