OpenID

The next thing we should implement is OpenID authorization. This *must* follow
after we've finished deploying to Heroku, because of the need for a public URL
endpoint to refer back to. 

I expect this to be a bit of a hassle, but this form of authentication is
clearly the wave of the future.
