OpenID

The final thing we should implement is OpenID authorization. This *must* follow
after we've finished deploying to Heroku, because of the need for a public URL
endpoint to refer back to. 

I expect this to be a bit of a hassle, but this form of authentication is
clearly the wave of the future. 

Once this feature is complete, I'm tempted to call the whole ``Volta`` seed 
project complete. Time to declare victory and move on!
